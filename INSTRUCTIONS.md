# Instruction

Our web page application does not differ that much from the guidelines specified in the statement.

# Navigation bar

Firstly, you will be able to move throw the web with the top navigation bar. This bar will display the following elements:

- Logo: It will appear at the left-most part of the navigatio bar. When clicking it, you will be redirected to the home 
page. 
- Links: Next to the logo, some links will appear to help you move through the pages in a more comfortable way. The links
appearing will depend on whether you are logged in or not.
  - When not logged in, you will see 2 links: one to the sign-in and the other to the sign up page.
  - When logged in, you will see 2 links: one to book catalogue and the other to the forum page.
- Proile picture: If you are logged in, at the right-most part of the navigation bar, you will see a profile picture. 
When clicking it, you will be redirected to the profile page.

# Authentication

Some pages require authentication, meaning that you will need to log in to access, otherwise you will be redirected to sign-in page.
The pages requiring you to sign-in are the catalogue, profile and forum pages. Trying to access them without logging in will
result, as mentioned, in being redirected to the sign-in page with a message indicating that you need to log in to access the page.

Moreover, even if you are logged in, you will not be able to access the catalogue and forum pages if you have not set up your username. 
In those cases, you will be redirected to the profile page with a message indicating that you need to set up your username to access.

# Profile

In the profile page, you will be able to set up your username and profile picture. To set your username you will need to 
write it in the input field and click the update button. Note that the username must be unique, otherwise you will not be able to set it up.
To set your profile picture, you will need to select an image from your computer by clicking on the button "Choose file" 
of the profile picture input. Note that the picture must be of type PNG, JPG, GIF or SVG, occupy less than 1MB and have 
a maximum dimensions of 400x400 pixels.

In addition, you will be able to see the email of your account, but will not be able to change it.
